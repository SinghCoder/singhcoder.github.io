# Hey There 👋

Alright, I had been thinking for a long time to start writing a blog. Not necessarily something technical, but just dump some of the thoughts, learnings, and resources for my future self. Starting out finally now, and this is the first post.

Well, that was it for the first post, stay tuned for the next one.

Scoop: next one is gonna be something related to the fitness journey I am on. 🏋️‍♂️

And LOL, GPT helping me with these emojis is just LIT 🔥
