        <h1 id="learning-to-learn">Learning to learn <a href="#learning-to-learn" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>This post is mostly a documentation of my learning process. I bought a Kindle (11th gen, paperwhite edition) in May of 2022, filled it with a few books, but really started to read just a few months back (~ Aug 2023).</p>
<p>But now, I am kind of hooked to it :). I read books, blogs (which I send via Send to Kindle browser extension) which I find interesting or someone shared on our company Slack which they find interesting. I also send some research papers as well (mostly by using sendtokindle Amazon page where you drag/drop files).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have ever completed any research paper which I had sent on my Kindle, although blogs and books I definitely have. I am still not sure if it is because research papers are boring to me, or I just have not found any interesting one yet..</p>
<p>Anyways, I take highlights from the content I have in my Kindle, but I feel I am starting to forget many things since I do not apply them practically most of the times..</p>
<p>I also listen to some podcasts, mostly the Founders podcast talking about great entrepreneurs who came before us.. But I had never made any notes out of them yet.</p>
<p>I am writing this post also to just know my process myself, and see what short-comings are in it..</p>
<p>Some of the actions I feel I can take to improve the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain a page/blog where I summarize the content in a few short points, and if I ever need to actually go in deep and see what I learned, I can always go and read my highlights.</li>
<li>Mostly read only the things I can apply in short term. For example:
<ol>
<li>I should ideally read only those self-help books which can actually help me with my current situation!!!</li>
<li>For technical things, I cannot always just read what I can apply on job immediately since that would limit the breadth I can explore, so I should atleast try to do a POC, implement whatever the author is talking about if it&rsquo;s a hands-on thing, or read the corresponding code myself if it is something open-source for example..</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If I am reading something just for the entertainment, then nothing needs to be done per se to remember or anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>With respect to all this, I would now try to list down all the things I have open for reading at the moment in my Kindle, and see what I know from them so far, and decide whether or not I want to continue reading those. This will be continuously added in <a href="../continuous-reading-zone/index.md">continous reading zone</a> blog..</p>
