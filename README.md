# Personal Blog

The repo contains the source code of my personal blog.

## Disclaimer and Legal Matters

The repository contains some scripts to extract my personal data from apps like CultFit. Exporting the data an app stores about you should be a feature provided by the app itself, but unfortunately, most of the apps don't provide this feature. So, I had to write some scripts to extract my data from the apps. I have tried to make the scripts as generic as possible, but they might not work for you. So, if you want to use them, you will have to modify them according to your needs.

If you are the owner of any of the apps, please understand that I am not trying to harm your business in any way, the data I am extracting is my own personal data, and I am not using it for any commercial purpose. I am just trying to make my life easier by having all my data in one place.

In any case, if you have any concerns, please feel free to contact me at email or LinkedIn with links available in [my public README](https://github.com/SinghCoder). I will be happy to discuss it with you.
